# Scholarly Language Learning Module

## LinguaFlow: AI-Powered Language Acquisition Platform

---

## The Vision

Language learning is fundamentally different from other subjects. You can't truly learn French by reading about French — you must *speak* it, *hear* it, *think* in it. Yet traditional classroom instruction often reduces language to grammar rules and vocabulary lists, producing students who can conjugate verbs but freeze when asked "Comment ça va?"

**LinguaFlow transforms language learning by making every student feel like they have a patient, infinitely available native speaker by their side — while giving teachers superhuman capabilities to monitor, assess, and personalise instruction for every learner.**

## The Research Foundation

Our design is grounded in decades of second language acquisition (SLA) research:

### Comprehensible Input Hypothesis (Krashen)
Language is acquired when learners receive input slightly above their current level (i+1). Our AI calibrates every interaction to each student's precise proficiency level.

### Output Hypothesis (Swain)
Production (speaking, writing) forces learners to notice gaps in their knowledge. Our system creates constant, low-stakes opportunities to produce language.

### Interaction Hypothesis (Long)
Negotiation of meaning in conversation drives acquisition. Our AI conversation partners are designed to create natural opportunities for clarification and repair.

### Noticing Hypothesis (Schmidt)
Learners must consciously notice linguistic features to acquire them. Our system highlights patterns, provides just-in-time explanations, and tracks what has been noticed vs. acquired.

### Sociocultural Theory (Vygotsky)
Learning happens in the Zone of Proximal Development through scaffolded interaction. Our AI provides dynamic scaffolding that adjusts in real-time.

### Spaced Repetition (Ebbinghaus)
Vocabulary and structures need systematic review at optimal intervals. Our system manages this automatically, invisibly woven into activities.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Production Over Passive Consumption

```
Traditional Approach:
- Watch video ✓
- Read grammar explanation ✓
- Complete fill-in-the-blank ✓
- NEVER ACTUALLY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ✗

LinguaFlow Approach:
- Every session includes speaking (even 30 seconds counts)
- Writing happens daily (even one sentence)
- Listening is interactive (respond, don't just hear)
- Reading leads to discussion (with AI or peers)
```

### 2. Communicative Competence Over Grammatical Accuracy

Students should be able to **accomplish communicative goals**, not just produce grammatically perfect sentences. We assess:

| Competence Type | What It Means | How We Develop It |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Linguistic** | Grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation | Systematic instruction + practice |
| **Sociolinguistic** | Appropriate language for context | Role-plays, scenario simulations |
| **Discourse** | Coherent extended speech/writing | Story telling, argumentation tasks |
| **Strategic** | Compensating for gaps | Communication strategy training |

### 3. Affective Filter Management

Anxiety kills language acquisition. Our system:
- Creates psychologically safe speaking environments
- Never judges or embarrasses
- Celebrates effort over accuracy
- Provides private practice before public performance
- Allows students to control their exposure level

### 4. Teacher Amplification, Not Replacement

**Good teachers become excellent. Excellent teachers become extraordinary.**

The AI handles:
- Infinite speaking practice opportunities
- Instant feedback on pronunciation
- Vocabulary drilling and spaced repetition
- Progress tracking and gap identification
- Assessment generation and marking

The teacher focuses on:
- Complex explanations and cultural nuance
- Motivating and inspiring students
- Managing class dynamics and differentiation
- High-stakes assessment validation
- Authentic communication experiences

## Curriculum Alignment

### Australian Curriculum: Languages

The Australian Curriculum organises language learning around two interrelated strands:

**Strand 1: Communicating**
- Socialising
- Informing
- Creating
- Translating
- Reflecting

**Strand 2: Understanding**
- Systems of language (grammar, vocabulary, text structure, sound/writing systems)
- Language variation and change
- Role of language and culture

### IB Language Frameworks

We support multiple IB programmes:

| Programme | Languages Offered | Levels | Assessment Types |
|-----------|------------------|--------|------------------|
| **PYP** | All 6 | Unit of Inquiry integration | Portfolio, observation |
| **MYP** | All 6 | Phases 1-6 | Criteria A-D (4 skills) |
| **DP Language B** | All 6 | SL, HL | Paper 1, Paper 2, Individual Oral, Written Assignment |
| **DP Language Ab Initio** | All 6 | SL only | Paper 1, Paper 2, Individual Oral |

### CEFR Mapping

All activities and assessments map to the Common European Framework of Reference:

## Integration with Curriculum Curator

The Language Learning Module integrates with the existing Curriculum Curator service:

```typescript
// Integration points with Curriculum Curator

interface CurriculumCuratorIntegration {
  // Curriculum alignment
  alignAssessmentToCurriculum(
    assessment: AssessmentTemplate,
    framework: 'ACARA' | 'IB_MYP' | 'IB_DP'
  ): Promise<CurriculumAlignment[]>;
  
  // Generate curriculum-aligned content
  generateAlignedContent(
    curriculumCodes: string[],
    contentType: 'reading' | 'listening' | 'writing_prompt' | 'speaking_scenario',
    targetLevel: CEFRLevel
  ): Promise<GeneratedContent>;
  
  // Track curriculum coverage
  getCurriculumCoverage(
    learnerId: string,
    framework: string,
    yearLevel: string
  ): Promise<CurriculumCoverageReport>;
  
  // IB-specific
  getIBCriteria(
    programme: 'MYP' | 'DP',
    course: 'Language_B' | 'Ab_Initio',
    level?: 'SL' | 'HL'
  ): Promise<IBCriteria[]>;
  
  mapToIBCriteria(
